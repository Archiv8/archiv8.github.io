Gatsby is a great tool to use when creating a static site. The basic installation and was easy, setup ran smoothly and I was soon working with a structure that I could manage easily.

As the site developed I began installing various plugins, gatsby-transformer-json and gatsby-transformer-yaml to access data stores and gatsby-plugin-mdx for writing page text.

Gatsby provides a React component system and includes various methods to manage and apply components to individual elements in pages. There is also the ability to provide page layouts, again the documentation includes tutorials and for achieving this:
